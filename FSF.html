        <h1>Fifty Shades Freed Details</h1>
            Fifty Shades Freed is a 2018 American erotic romantic drama film directed by James Foley and written by Niall Leonard, based on the novel of the same name by E. L. James. It is the third and final installment in the Fifty Shades film series after Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) and Fifty Shades Darker (2017). The film stars Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan as Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, respectively, and follows the newlywed couple as they must deal with the sins of their past when Ana's former boss (Eric Johnson) begins to stalk her.
            <br/>Principal photography on Fifty Shades Freed began simultaneously with Darker in February 2016 in Paris and Vancouver. The film was released in the United States on February 9, 2018; it had a limited IMAX release. It has grossed $137 million worldwide and, like its previous two predecessors, received negative reviews, with criticism aimed at its screenplay and performances.
            <br/><strong>Plot</strong>
            <br/>Newlyweds Christian Grey and Anastasia 'Ana' Steele cut short their exotic honeymoon and return to Seattle after receiving news of a break-in at Christian's corporate headquarters. Some computer files were stolen, and security camera tapes identify the perpetrator as Jack Hyde, Ana's former boss who was fired for sexual assault. Meanwhile, Ana is introduced to her new personal security team.
            <br/>Christian surprises Ana with a new house and has hired architect Gia Matteo to rebuild it. Ana is dismayed when Gia, an attractive young woman, openly flirts with Christian in Ana's presence. Ana privately threatens to dismiss Gia if she continues her flirtatious behavior, forcing her to stop.
            <br/>When Christian is away on a business trip, Ana disregards his wishes that she stay at home, and goes out for a drink with her friend, Kate Kavanagh. Kate, who is dating Christian's older brother, Elliot, confides to Ana that their relationship may be fizzling; Elliot is working closely with Gia, the architect, and Kate is suspicious about their relationship. When Ana returns home, she encounters Jack Hyde, who holds her hostage and attempts to kidnap her. Ana's security team subdue him and he is arrested. After an argument with Christian about her having sneaked out to see Kate, Ana berates Christian for being overly controlling and possessive and demands more freedom. Soon after, Christian surprises Ana with a trip to Aspen, bringing along Kate, Elliot, Mia, and Jos√©.
            <br/>Christian and Ana continue with their erotic sexual experimentation, but matters become complicated when Ana announces she is pregnant. Christian is deeply disturbed, saying he had other plans for their early years together. He leaves, going on a night-long drunken bender. The next day, Ana discovers that Christian had recently contacted his ex-lover and former BDSM dominant, Elena Lincoln. Meanwhile, Jack Hyde is released on a $500,000 bail.
            <br/><strong>Production</strong>
            <br/>A film adaptation of the first book was produced by Michael De Luca Productions, with Universal Pictures and Focus Features securing the rights to the trilogy in March 2012. At a fan screening in New York City on February 6, director Sam Taylor-Johnson announced that the book sequels Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed would also be adapted, with the first to be released in 2016. Right after the announcement, Taylor-Johnson told Digital Spy that, "It's not my decision [to return], and I haven't been privy to any of the discussions."[6] On November 12, 2015, TheWrap confirmed that James Foley would direct both sequels which would be shot back-to-back in 2016, with Niall Leonard writing the script and Michael De Luca and Dana Brunetti returning to produce along with E. L. James and Marcus Viscidi. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan would also return for lead roles. On February 8, 2016, Arielle Kebbel was cast in the film to play Gia Matteo, a beautiful architect who is hired by Christian to build his home. On February 12, 2016, Eric Johnson was cast to play Jack Hyde, Ana's boss at SIP and stalker. On February 20, 2016, Brant Daugherty signed on to play Sawyer, the personal body guard for Anastasia Steele.
            <br/><strong>Filming</strong>
            <br/>In November 2015, Universal Studios announced that Fifty Shades Darker and this film would be shot back-to-back with principal photography scheduled to commence in early 2016. Filming began in Paris and Vancouver from February 9, 2016, to July 12, 2016, under the working title, "Further Adventures of Max and Banks 2 & 3."
            <br/><strong>Release</strong>
