            <strong>Padman Movie Details</strong>
            <br/>Pad Man is a 2018 Indian biographical comedy-drama film written and directed by R. Balki, featuring Akshay Kumar, Sonam Kapoor, and Radhika Apte in lead roles.<br/>It is based on the short story The Sanitary Man of Sacred Land in Twinkle Khanna's book The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad, which is inspired by the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham, a social activist from Tamil Nadu who introduced low-cost sanitary pads. The film was released theatrically on 9 February 2018.
            <br/><strong>Casting</strong><br/>
Akshay Kumar plays Arunachalam Muruganantham, also known as "India's Menstrual Man". Kumar was not the first choice to play the role. Khanna thought of a few actors but she eventually handed it to Kumar after Murugan's insistence and because she thought it would be a game-changing event if Kumar, who the Indian public idolises and men look up to, wore sanitary pad.
<br/>
<strong>Filming</strong>

<br/>Pad Man is the only second Bollywood film to be granted access to shoot the film inside the headquarters of the United Nations in New York City after Half Girlfriend in 2016.
<br/>Pre-production began in March 2017, and principal photography commenced on March 14. Filming moved to Delhi in April. Murugan worked closely with Kumar and Khanna on set in India, making sure every detail was accurate from the way he built his machine, to how to operate it, even his own posture. 

<br/>After filming ended in India, the team travelled to New York City where pivotal scenes were filmmed in Brooklyn Bridge, Times Square and Jazz at Lincoln Center, as well as the United Nations headquarter.<br/> It is the second Bollywood film to be shot at the site following Half Girlfriend while Hollywood film The Interpreter was the first.

<br/><strong>Release</strong>
<br/>The film was initially planned to be released on 13 April 2018, but was later moved to 26 January. However, on 19 January, it was announced that the film has been postponed to 9 February 2018 to avoid clash with Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Padmaavat. In India, the film will be shown across 2,800 screens. Regarding the possible box office clash with Aiyaary which releases on the same day, Kumar denounced the tension saying that it was unlikely since both films have different subjects and themes.
Pad Man is scheduled to be released across 3350 screens worldwide; 2750 screens in India and 600 screens overseas. Being a social issue based film, the producer's are planning to show the film in various schools in smaller towns and cities with the aid of various ministries and the government.

<br/><strong>Marketing</strong>
<br/>The first trailer was released on 15 December 2017. Soon after, the trailer began trending on Twitter with the hashtag #PadManTrailer. Scenes showing Kumar casually trying to wear a sanitary napkin and the other handing them to his sister became a trending topic. A second poster was released on 25 December which shows Kumar holding cotton in his hand with words like "Fighter, Genius, Innovation, Unreal Man, No Shame, Real Problem and Passion" written all around. The Times of India called it a "unique poster".

<br/><strong>Critical reception</strong>
<br/>On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on 9 reviews, and an average rating of 6.8/10.
